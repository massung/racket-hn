# Hacker News Reader

This is a simple HN reader written in [Racket][racket]. It uses the [canvas-list][canvas-list] control as a dependency.

For the style and color scheme I drew _heavy_ inspiration from [@mattrighetti's HNReaderApp][mattrighetti]. His looks fantastic and I highly recommend taking a look!
